Traveling sales man problem. My solution loads the points from the file passed into the program using '<' in the terminal, then
creates a list of point, and builds a path taking the shortest distance point from the point it the program is at. The program
is built for speed not efficency. In other words my program will find a path connecting all the points very quickly but will 
the path given will not always be the shortest..
